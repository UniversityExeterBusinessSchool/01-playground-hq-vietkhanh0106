# My Structure - Student 14

## What I See in My Data
[Describe the codes, letters, numbers]
HEIGHT: 1
WIDTH: 6
TYPE: SINGLE_ROW
COLOR: BLUE

## What I Think This Means
[Interpret the patterns]
Height: 1 -> flat, not stacked
width: 6 -> row of six bricks, though i only have blocks made of 2 bricks -> join 3 blocks together 

## What This Could Be
[Your best guess - playground equipment?] A bench, maybe?

## Questions I Have
[What don't you know yet?] Nothing
